## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Panel detail modal on the dashboard** — click any heatmap tile (desktop only) to open a modal with the panel's live readings (V/I/W, temp, RSSI, efficiency, duty cycle) and a power history chart sourced from `/api/history/panel?slot=N&range=day|week|month`.
  - Slot lookup uses `/api/panels` (barcode last-6 → tsdb slot), cached after first fetch.
  - **Peer overlay**: a dashed "string median" line overlays the panel's own line whenever there are ≥2 peers in the same string, so a single-panel dip is visually separable from string-wide shading.
  - **Live refresh**: live readings re-paint on the dashboard's 5-second tick while the modal is open; chart re-fetches on range change / reopen.
  - Hidden on viewports ≤768 px (modal would be too cramped on a phone); the heat tile cursor reverts to default in that case.
- **Sortable Node Table** — every column header (`Name`, `Addr`, `Barcode`, `String / MPPT`, `V`, `A`, `Power`, `Temp`, `Age`, `State`) is clickable. Click cycles ascending/descending; an arrow indicator marks the active column. Numeric columns default to descending on first click; State sorts by health order (`ok → warn → bad → stale`) so reversing surfaces problems first.
- **YAML generator emits `esphome.devices:` block + propagates `device_id`** to child sensors. Group panels into HA devices per-MPPT, per-inverter, per-panel, or stay flat (no devices) via a selector in the Tools view. The choice persists in `localStorage['tools-grouping']`.
  - Schema-level propagation: setting `device_id:` once on a panel base config now flows automatically to all child sensors (power_in, peak_power, voltage_in, etc.) — no need to repeat it.
- **Brand logo mark** — SVG mark in the sidebar header, matching favicon (`docs/images/logo.svg`).
- **Single-page web app at `/app`** (full UI redesign, R1–R7)
  - All views collapsed into one shell with sidebar nav and hash routing (`/app#dashboard`, `/app#history`, `/app#topology`, `/app#nodes`, `/app#tools`, `/app#diagnostics`, `/app#cca`).
  - Legacy paths (`/`, `/nodes`, `/status`, `/yaml`, `/cca`, `/history`) redirect to the corresponding `#view` so existing bookmarks keep working.
  - HA Ingress compliant: redirects use relative `Location: app#...` so they resolve under any URL prefix, and the SPA derives `BASE_PATH` from `window.location.pathname`.
  - Sidebar footer now carries a GitHub link, a `°C` / `°F` toggle (persists via `localStorage['tempUnit']`), and the existing theme toggle.
- **On-flash time-series history** (Phase 3 — esp_tsdb backed)
  - Persistent per-snapshot rollups (system + per-inverter) and per-panel power survive reboots and OTA updates.
  - Three lazy-opened panel DBs covering up to 48 panels (16 base params each).
  - New endpoints: `/api/history/power?range=day|week|month|year`, `/api/history/panel?slot=N&range=...`, `/api/panels`, `/api/tsdb/stats`.
  - Diagnostics view shows per-DB record counts, range, evictions, plus LittleFS partition usage.
  - Requires the `esp_tsdb` external component and a `tsdb` LittleFS partition (see [`docs/tsdb-integration.md`](docs/tsdb-integration.md)).
- **Topology view** — read-only inverter → string → panel hierarchy with live V/I/W/°C, search filter, expand/collapse, color-coded panel tiles.
- **Heatmap dashboard** — fixed-size colored tiles per panel grouped by string, replacing the old variable-height bar chart. Same good/warn/bad/dead bands so the legend still applies.
- **Color legend strip** on the dashboard showing the good/warn/bad/dead thresholds.
- **"This month" hero card** (replaces "Avg temperature") — sums current month's daily history plus today's running total; subline shows kWh/day average.
- **"% vs 5 min ago · % of peak" trend** on the Current Power hero card once a 5-min window of comparison data is available.
- **Inverter and string rename** — click the ✎ next to any inverter or string heading in Topology to set a friendly display name. Persists to NVS via `global_preferences` (keyed by canonical YAML/CCA name). YAML config remains the source of truth for identity; the override is purely cosmetic and used everywhere those names appear (Dashboard, Topology, alerts).
  - New endpoints: `POST /api/inverters/rename`, `POST /api/strings/rename`.
- **Per-string panel nameplate rating** — click the rating pill in Topology to set per-panel watts. Persists to NVS. When set, panel tiles show "% of rated" alongside watts and `panelClass` switches to rating-based health classification (with a "<5% of total nameplate → string sleeping" check so dawn doesn't paint everything red). String roll-up shows total output as % of total nameplate.
  - New endpoint: `POST /api/strings/rating` with `{label, rating_w}` (rating_w=0 clears).
- **Tools view** absorbs the YAML generator and adds inline Reset Peak Power / Reset Node Table / Restart device actions with toast feedback.
- **Diagnostics view** adds a TSDB section (open DBs, record counts, oldest/newest timestamps, evictions, file sizes) alongside the existing memory / network / UART / version cards.
- **Node table Export / Import** restored on the Nodes view (same JSON shape as before).

### Changed
- **Visual polish across the SPA** — a single design language across cards:
  - 2 px accent rainbow rail (`--accent → --accent-2 → --accent-3`) across the top of all major container cards (inverter cards, chart cards, topology inverter cards, the panel detail modal).
  - Subtle diagonal accent gradient overlay (green→blue→transparent) on container cards.
  - Smaller, lighter gradient on grouped stat tiles (`.hist-stat-card`, used on History and Diagnostics) — no rail, since rails on every tile turn into wallpaper.
  - Daily-energy bars use a vertical gradient (top → faded at baseline) instead of flat 0.85-opacity accent-2.
  - System power chart's area uses a vertical gradient (accent at top, transparent at bottom) instead of a flat 12 %-opacity slab.
  - Sidebar gets a subtle vertical gradient (accent overlay top → `bg-2 → bg-3` base).
  - "Current Power" hero card picks up the same accent diagonal gradient as the panel modal, with an accent-green border tint.
  - Brand name in sidebar bumped from inherited 14 px → 16 px.
- **Panel heat tile** "% rated" badge moved to its own line for readability on narrow tiles.
- **Dashboard mobile layout** — responsive sidebar drawer + tile reflow for ≤768 px viewports.
- **TSDB buffer pools moved to PSRAM** (`TSDB_ALLOC_PSRAM`) — reclaims ~28 KB of internal heap on units with PSRAM. Internal heap low-water improved from ~110 KB to ~150 KB on the 8 MB AtomS3R reference rig.
- Diagnostics view active-sockets card no longer crashes when the inner span is replaced (`innerHTML`-based render).
- Sparkline buffers and string-grouping maps continue to key on canonical names so renames don't lose history or break grouping.

### Fixed
- **Aggregate sensors stuck at "Unknown value"** when their names collided under keyword inference. No-address sensors infer their type from `name` keywords, but the matcher used raw substring tests: `"Invalid Checksum Count"` matched `sum` inside "check**sum**" (→ power sum), `"Free Internal RAM"` matched `e in` inside "fre**e in**ternal" (→ energy), and `count` was tested before `frame`. Each hub setter holds a single pointer, so colliding names overwrote each other and the losers never published. The Tools YAML generator emits exactly these names, so generated configs were affected too (surfaced in discussion #11). Keyword matching is now whole-word (`\b` boundaries) via one shared classifier, with specific categories ordered before broad ones.
- **OTA reboot crash inside `tsdb_close_h`** (`IllegalInstruction` → newlib `_lock_close` assertion → `panic_abort`). The drain loop only checked `uxQueueMessagesWaiting() == 0`, but the writer task could already have pulled the last row and be mid-`fwrite` — holding the FILE's per-stream lock. `fclose` then tripped newlib. Fix: writer recognises a sentinel `EncodedRow` (timestamp = `UINT32_MAX`), gives a `writer_done_` binary semaphore, and self-deletes. `flush_and_close` enqueues the sentinel after its drain and waits on the semaphore (1500 ms cap) before any `tsdb_close_h` — no possible race with `fclose`. Filed upstream as a note on `zakery292/esp_tsdb#1` suggesting `tsdb_close_h` mirror the mutex-held fclose pattern already used in `tsdb_sync_h`.
- **`process_power_frame` / `process_09_frame` substr OOB** crashes on short or malformed RS485 frames. `process_09_frame` did `frame.substr(40, 6)` without checking length; with `-fno-exceptions` (ESP-IDF default), `std::out_of_range` becomes `abort` and the unwind surfaced as `InstFetchPrivilege`. Added upfront length guards. `process_27_frame` already guarded its reads.
- **Panel modal showed "—" for Current in** — the `/api/devices` JSON field is named `"current"` (filled from `device.current_in`), not `"current_in"`; modal now reads the correct key. Duty cycle is already a percent in the JSON, so the suffix is now `%`.
- **Panel modal card was transparent** because the CSS used `var(--bg-1)`, which isn't defined (`:root` defines `--bg`, `--bg-2`, `--bg-3`, `--bg-4`). Switched to `--bg-2`.
- **Panel modal showed prior panel's history** during the in-flight fetch when reopening on a different panel — chart polylines now reset to empty + "…" placeholder on every open/range-change.
- **YAML generator emitted redundant `tigo_mppt_mppt_4`-style IDs** when the user's label already started with the type tag. Generator now skips the type prefix when the slug already begins with it (so "MPPT 4" → `tigo_mppt_4`, "FlexBoss A" → `tigo_inverter_flexboss_a`).
- **History wiped on every reboot** when using esp_tsdb (only with `feat/handle-based-api` fork). Root cause: `tsdb_open` used `stat()` to detect file existence, but joltwallet's `esp_littlefs` returns `ENOENT` from `stat()` for files that `fopen("rb")` immediately reads bytes back from. Every boot took the create-new path and `fopen("w+b")` truncated the existing file. Fix in the upstream PR (`zakery292/esp_tsdb#1`): try `fopen(..., "r+b")` first; fall through to create-new only on failure. Slot map (panel_map.json) was unaffected because it uses `open(wb)+write+close` per save, which never hits the bad code path.
- **Nodes view crashed at active-sockets** during R5 diag-view rendering (fixed in `2f14ad8`).
- **Persistence cleanup on shutdown**: `TigoMonitorComponent::on_shutdown` now drains the TSDB writer queue (best-effort, 800 ms cap), `tsdb_close_h`s every open handle, and unmounts LittleFS so the journal commits cleanly before `esp_restart`.

### Dependencies
- New optional dependency: `esp_tsdb` (currently from local fork at `feat/handle-based-api`; will return to a registry pin once `zakery292/esp_tsdb#1` is merged and tagged).
- New required dependency for history features: `joltwallet/littlefs` (any 1.16+).

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Home Assistant Ingress support** ([#7](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/pull/7)) — contributed by [@aeozyalcin](https://github.com/aeozyalcin)
  - Web UI now works when proxied through Home Assistant Ingress (e.g. the [hass_ingress](https://github.com/lovelylain/hass_ingress) integration)
  - Nav links are set dynamically from `window.location.pathname` so they resolve under any URL prefix
  - `apiFetch()` prepends the detected `BASE_PATH` to all `/api/*` requests
  - Post-reset redirect on the Status page returns to the ingress-prefixed root
  - Purely client-side JavaScript change — no C++ or ESPHome config changes required for standalone access
  - See [`docs/WEB_SERVER_README.md`](docs/WEB_SERVER_README.md#home-assistant-ingress) for setup details

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **ESPHome 2026.3 compatibility: `register_component` removed from public API**
  - Removed redundant `App.register_component(this)` call in `setup()` — component is already registered via codegen
- **Deprecation warning: `wifi_ssid()` deprecated in ESPHome 2026.3.0**
  - Switched to `wifi_ssid_to()` buffer-based API (old API removed in 2026.9.0)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- **Remote package compile error: `esp_http_client.h` not found**
  - `__init__.py` used `cg.add_library()` which doesn't work for ESP-IDF built-in components
  - Now uses `esp32.include_builtin_idf_component("esp_http_client")` — the correct ESPHome pattern
  - Only affected remote/git installations; local path installs worked because the IDF component was already resolved
- **Deprecation warning: `IPAddress::str()` removed in ESPHome 2026.8.0**
  - Switched to `str_to()` API in web server status page

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Output-Channel Telemetry** ([#6](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/pull/6)) — contributed by [@aeozyalcin](https://github.com/aeozyalcin)
  - New per-device `current_out` and `power_out` sensors derived from duty cycle
  - New `power_in` sensor (explicit input power with calibration applied)
  - New hub-level `Total Output Power` aggregate sensor
  - Input vs output power split enables accurate per-device efficiency tracking
  - `power_out` and `current_out` displayed on web UI device cards
- **TS4-A-S (Monitor-Only) Module Support** ([#5](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/issues/5))
  - Auto-detect monitor-only modules (voltage_out ≈ 0, voltage_in > 1V)
  - Monitor-only devices mirror input values to output and report 100% efficiency
- **Aggregate Sensor Naming: Input/Output Distinction**
  - Hub sensors now support `input`/`output` keywords for power and energy
  - e.g. "Total Input Power", "Total Output Power", "Total Input Energy", "Total Output Energy"
  - Backward compatible — existing names like "Total System Power" still route to input variants

### Fixed
- **Duty Cycle Sensor: HA Now Reports 0–100%**
  - Raw UART byte (0–255) was published directly to Home Assistant as "%"
  - Now normalized to 0–100% matching the web UI display
- **YAML Generator: Hub-level sensor output format** ([#4](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/issues/4))
  - YAML config page (`/yaml`) was generating hub-level sensors in a nested sub-key format (`power_sum:`, `energy_sum:`, etc.) under a single platform entry, which is invalid
  - Hub sensors now correctly generate as separate `- platform: tigo_monitor` entries with keyword-rich names that match the sensor type auto-detection in `sensor.py`
  - Names updated to use proper keywords: "Total System Power", "Total System Energy", "Active Device Count", etc.
- **DeviceData struct field initialization** — `current_out`, `power_in`, `power_out` now default to `0.0f`

### Changed
- **Power calculation consolidated into `DeviceData`** — power was previously calculated in 8 separate places; now computed once during frame processing
- **Daily energy history and overview totals switched to output-channel tracking**
- **Documentation: Quick Start overhaul** ([#3](https://github.com/RAR/esphome-tigomonitor/issues/3))
  - `external_components` now uses expanded `type: git` / `url:` format instead of shorthand `github://` which may not resolve correctly
  - Board changed from `esp32dev` to `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` (generic ESP32-S3)
  - Added `logger:` to base config
  - Added required empty `sensor:`, `text_sensor:`, `binary_sensor:` stub sections with explanation — without these, compilation fails due to missing generated headers
  - Added generic ESP32-S3 PSRAM config example alongside existing M5Stack example
  - Added PSRAM bootloader gotcha: must clean build + erase flash when switching from non-PSRAM to PSRAM config
- **Documentation: Expanded system-level sensor reference** in `CONFIGURATION.md`
  - Added all 9 hub-level sensor types with complete YAML examples (was only showing 4)
  - Documented full keyword list for each sensor type including all accepted synonyms
  - Added note clarifying that hub sensors must each be their own platform entry
- **Troubleshooting: New sections**
  - Added fix for `fatal error: sensor/sensor.h: No such file or directory` compile error
  - Added `external_components` loading troubleshooting with correct format examples
  - Added PSRAM not detected after enabling (bootloader rebuild required)

  - Correct structure: `[starting_index:4 hex][num_entries:4 hex][entries...]` at offset 18
  - Now correctly parses all device entries (was only parsing 2 per frame instead of 12)
  - Node table now properly populates with all device long addresses from gateway

  - Allows calibration against inverter or other reference measurements
  - Range: 0.5 to 2.0 (50% to 200%)
  - Example: `power_calibration: 1.184` for 18.4% adjustment

### Fixed
- **Night Mode Display Issues**
  - Dashboard API now returns zero watts during night mode instead of residual cached power
  - Cached total power properly zeroed when all devices go offline
- **Daily Energy Tracking**
  - Fixed race condition between `update_daily_energy()` and `check_midnight_reset()` archival
  - Only midnight reset archives when `reset_at_midnight` enabled

  - Updated API methods: `add_missed_frame_sensor()`, `get_missed_frame_count()`
  - Log messages now use "Frame missed!" instead of "Packet missed!"
  - Tigo serial protocol uses frames, not packets

### Improved
- **Midnight Reset Optimization**
  - Batched flash writes to reduce heap fragmentation

  - Optimized `load_peak_power_data()`: Eliminate temporary string allocations
  - Optimized `save_node_table()`: Reuse string buffer for preference keys
  - Optimized `load_node_table()`: Reuse string buffer for preference keys
  - Root cause: `std::string pref_key = "peak_" + device.addr` created 30+ allocations per reset
  - Solution: Static string buffer with reserve(32), reuse with `pref_key = "peak_"; pref_key += device.addr`
  - Eliminates heap fragmentation from alloc/free cycles

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- **Memory Monitoring Sensors** for Home Assistant
  - Internal RAM Free (KB) - Current free internal RAM
  - Internal RAM Min (KB) - Minimum free since boot (watermark)
  - PSRAM Free (KB) - Current free PSRAM
  - Stack Free (bytes) - Current task stack free space
  - All sensors update every 60 seconds
  - Keyword-based auto-detection in YAML config
  - Enables memory health tracking and alerting in Home Assistant

### Fixed
- **Critical Memory Leaks** in frame processing
  - `frame_to_hex_string()`: Changed from `+=` to `push_back()` to eliminate repeated allocations
  - `remove_escape_sequences()`: Changed from `+=` to `push_back()` to eliminate repeated allocations
  - Both functions process hundreds of frames per hour
  - Fixes gradual heap exhaustion even without web UI usage
  - Stable memory usage over long-term operation
- **CCA Data Persistence Bug**
  - Fixed `load_node_table()` not loading CCA data after frame09_barcode removal
  - Save format changed from 10 fields to 9 fields, but load logic was checking for 10+ fields
  - Now properly handles both 9-field (current) and 10-field (old) formats
  - CCA labels now correctly display after restart with `sync_cca_on_startup: false`
  - Added backward compatibility for old saved data
- **Negative Temperature Support**
  - Temperature values now correctly handle sub-zero readings
  - Implemented proper 12-bit two's complement conversion
  - Supports range: -204.8°C to +204.7°C
  - Critical for winter operation and cold climate installations

### Changed
- **PSRAM Optimization for Frame Processing**
  - `frame_to_hex_string()` now uses `psram_string` internally (saves 1-3KB per frame)
  - `remove_escape_sequences()` now uses `psram_string` internally (saves 500-1500 bytes per frame)
  - Combined savings: 3-5KB internal RAM per frame processed
  - Conditional compilation: PSRAM path on ESP-IDF, original code on other platforms
  - Preserves internal RAM for critical operations
- **Enhanced Memory Logging**
  - Added more detailed logging for CCA data loading
  - Improved diagnostic messages for node table restoration
  - Better tracking of memory usage patterns

### Technical Details
- Memory leak fixes eliminate continuous heap fragmentation
- PSRAM optimizations reduce internal RAM pressure by 3-5KB per frame
- Frame processing functions handle thousands of frames per day
- `push_back()` with `reserve()` provides single allocation vs repeated allocations with `+=`
- PSRAM access ~4x slower but negligible impact (microseconds) vs memory benefits
- All optimizations maintain backward compatibility

### Performance Impact
- **Stable heap usage**: No more gradual memory exhaustion
- **Reduced fragmentation**: Internal RAM allocations eliminated for large buffers
- **Long-term reliability**: Systems can run indefinitely without memory issues
- **PSRAM utilization**: Large temporary buffers now in PSRAM instead of internal RAM

### Upgrade Notes
1. Recommended for all users - critical stability fixes
2. Memory monitoring sensors are optional but recommended for diagnostics
3. No configuration changes required for bug fixes
4. No breaking changes - fully backward compatible

### Breaking Changes

2. For 15+ devices, ensure ESP32-S3 with PSRAM (M5Stack AtomS3R recommended)
3. Add `CONFIG_UART_ISR_IN_IRAM: "y"` to sdkconfig_options for better UART reliability
4. Optionally add web authentication and/or API token for security
5. Review new configuration options in README

### Security Recommendations
- Use strong passwords for web authentication (10+ characters)
- Use randomly generated tokens for API authentication (32+ characters)
- Consider separate credentials for web and API access
- Use HTTPS if exposing outside local network
- Limit access via firewall rules
